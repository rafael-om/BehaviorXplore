Synthetic data corresponding to data whose values ​​were generated directly from the sum of complex exponentials. The matrix (corresponding to the time series) has dimensions of 400 x 8640 and non-normalized values. The matrix is ​​found in the file matrix.npy.

In addition, the respective frequency and amplitude values ​​of the complex exponentials used are found in the files frequency_list.npy and amps_list.npy.
