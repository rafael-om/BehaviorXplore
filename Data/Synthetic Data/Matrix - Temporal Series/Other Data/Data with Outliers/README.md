# README

Synthetic data corresponding to data whose values ​​were generated directly from a standard normal distribution, replacing some values ​​with outliers, with probability 0.05.

Three magnitudes of outlier values ​​were used:
- In the "Gaussian Data with Outliers - I" directory, outliers are values ​​between 10 and 20.
- In the "Gaussian Data with Outliers - II" directory, outliers are values ​​between 50 and 100.
- In the "Gaussian Data with Outliers - III" directory, outliers are values ​​between 500 and 1000.

The matrix (corresponding to the time series) has dimensions of 400 x 8640 and has normalized values ​​(between 0 and 1). The matrix is ​​found in the normalized.npy file.
