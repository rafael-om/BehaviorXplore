Synthetic data corresponding to data whose values ​​were generated directly from a uniform distribution, but the columns are repeated at intervals of 218, generating linearity between the training data. The matrix (corresponding to the time series) has dimensions of 400 x 8640 and has unnormalized values. The matrix is ​​found in the file matrix.npy.
