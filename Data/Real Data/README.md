Cleaned and processed PEMSd3 dataset. The temporal_series.npy file contains the unnormalized time series of vehicle flow, and the transition_matrix.npy file contains the graph of this region of the dataset.

In addition, the AdjacencyList.csv, AvgSpeed.csv, and MaxSpeed.csv files contain the adjacency list of the graph, the average speed of vehicles on each street (vertex), and the maximum speed on each street, respectively. These files were used to generate the transition matrix in the transition_matrix.npy file.
